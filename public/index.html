His style of Magic is unique and unlike any other performer out there. He has made himself so skilled by practicing hours and hours for years that you'll almost feel like you're watching a Movie when you experience his special choreographed Close-up Magic Acts performed live on stage. He has been fortunately blowing people's mind through his extraordinary Sleight of Hand Artistry at National and Abroad Venues for 5 years. And at such young age, he has established himself as an 'International Magic Creator' by releasing his original creations of magic tricks on a global platform."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
